# Workflow Builder

## Overview

Workflow Builder is a simple React application that lets you run text through a fixed 4-step workflow.
It helps you clean messy text, summarize it, extract key points, and automatically tag it into a category.

This project is built for learning and experimenting with basic NLP-style transformations in a clean UI.
